<!-- ## About -->

I am a PhD student in applied mathematics, supervised by [Hélène Mathis](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~mathis/).  
As part of my doctoral studies, I also teach at the Faculty of Science, University of Montpellier — see the [Teaching](https://christinamahmoud.github.io/teaching/) section for more details.
## Research

<!-- Research interests
====== -->
My research focuses on the numerical approximation of **hyperbolic systems with relaxation**, which appear in various applications involving non-equilibrium processes, such as fluid flows and two-phase mixtures. These systems take the general form:
<!-- <div style="text-align:center;">
$$
\partial_t \mathbf{W} + \partial_x \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{W}) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W}),
$$
</div> -->
<!-- where $$\mathbf{W}$$ is the vector of conserved variables, $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{W})$$ is the flux function, and $$\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W})$$ represents a relaxation source term. -->
<!-- The parameter $$\varepsilon > 0$$ induces multiscale dynamics and presents major challenges for the design of robust numerical methods. -->
I focus on the development and analysis of **asymptotic-preserving** numerical schemes, designed to remain stable and accurate across both equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes. These schemes are particularly suited to two-phase flow problems, where relaxation terms capture the exchange dynamics between coexisting phases like vapor and liquid.

## Topics of interest

- Hyperbolic systems,
- Relaxation,
- Numerical analysis Finite Volume schemes, 
- Asymptotic preserving schemes,
- Compressible two-phase flows

<!-- How to contact me
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
