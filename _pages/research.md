My research focuses on the numerical approximation of **hyperbolic systems with relaxation**, which arise in non-equilibrium processes such as fluid flows and two-phase mixtures. I work on the development and analysis of **asymptotic-preserving (AP)** finite-volume schemes that remain stable and accurate in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes. These methods are particularly suited to **compressible two-phase flows**, where relaxation terms model exchanges between coexisting phases (e.g., vapor and liquid).

$$
\partial_t \mathbf{W} + \partial_x \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{W}) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\,\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W}),
$$

where $\mathbf{W}$ is the vector of conserved variables, $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{W})$ is the flux, and $\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W})$ is the relaxation source term. The small parameter $\varepsilon>0$ induces multiscale dynamics that challenge robust scheme design.
