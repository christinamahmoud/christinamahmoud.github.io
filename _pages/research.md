<!-- ## Research Focus-->
My research focuses on the numerical approximation of **hyperbolic systems with relaxation**, which appear in various applications involving non-equilibrium processes, such as fluid flows and two-phase mixtures.
<!-- <div style="text-align:center;">
$$
\partial_t \mathbf{W} + \partial_x \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{W}) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W}),
$$
</div> -->
<!-- where $$\mathbf{W}$$ is the vector of conserved variables, $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{W})$$ is the flux function, and $$\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{W})$$ represents a relaxation source term. -->
<!-- The parameter $$\varepsilon > 0$$ induces multiscale dynamics and presents major challenges for the design of robust numerical methods. -->
I focus on the development and analysis of **asymptotic-preserving** numerical schemes, designed to remain stable and accurate across both equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes. These schemes are particularly suited to two-phase flow problems, where relaxation terms capture the exchange dynamics between coexisting phases like vapor and liquid.
